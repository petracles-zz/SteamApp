# SteamApp
Using FramerJS, ParseJS, and Steam's Web API, we're building a web-app that is designed to help PC gamers figure out what game they should play in their Steam library at that point in time.

In the master, you will find the .coffee file that currently holds (...all of...) the code. It has not been modularized yet, so performance might be a bit sluggish. To see the current build in action, go here:

To see what we're building on the back-end of the service, feel free to check out our Apiary, here:

While you'll need Framer Studio to play with the .framer file yourself, feel free to check out the DOM and see how the project is being put together on the front-end of things. We hope what you like what you see so far, and check back December 14th to see our final product!
